  When \environment sends (\textsc{fund}, $c$, hops, \texttt{sub\_parties} =
  (fundee, counterparty), \texttt{outer\_parties} = (\charlie, \dave)) to \alice
  in the real world, the same thing as in the ideal world happens first, then
  VChan() takes place, then again the same as in the ideal world. On the other
  hand, in the ideal world the same thing as in the real world happens first,
  then VChan() is simulated by \simulator, then again the same as in the real
  world.

  When \environment sends (\textsc{fund}, $c$, hops, \texttt{sub\_parties} =

  in the ideal world, the simulator receives (\textsc{fund you}, $c$, \bob,
  \charlie, \alice) by fundee TODO: continue
