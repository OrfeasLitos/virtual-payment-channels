    \begin{itemize}
      \item On receiving (\textsc{relay}, \texttt{in\_msg}, $P$, $R$,
      \texttt{in\_mode}) by \fchan (\texttt{in\_mode} $\in$ \{input, output,
      network\}, $P \in \{\alice, \bob\}$), handle (\texttt{in\_msg}) with the
      simulated party $P$ as if it was received from $R$ by means of
      \texttt{in\_mode}. In case simulated $P$ does not exist yet, initialise it
      as an \textsc{ln} ITI. If there is a resulting message \texttt{out\_msg}
      that is to be sent by simulated $P$ to $R'$ by means of
      $\texttt{out\_mode} \in$ \{input, output, network\}, send (\textsc{relay},
      \texttt{out\_msg}, $P$, $R'$, \texttt{out\_mode}) to \fchan.
      \item On receiving by \fchan a message to be sent by $P$ to $R$ via the
      network, carry on with this action (i.e. send this message via the
      internal \adversary).
      \item Relay any other incoming message to the internal \adversary
      unmodified.
      \item On receiving a message (\texttt{msg}) by the internal \adversary, if it is
      addressed to one of the parties that correspond to \fchan, handle the
      message internally with the corresponding simulated party. Otherwise relay
      the message to its intended recipient unmodified. \Comment{Other
      recipients are \environment, \ledger or parties unrelated to \fchan}
    \end{itemize}

    Given that \fchan relays all messages and that we simulate the real-world
    machines that correspond to \fchan, the simulation is perfectly
    indistinguishable from the real world.
