\section{Protocol Description}
  \textbf{Conceptually,} Elmo is split into four actions: channel opening,
  payments, cooperative closing and unilateral closing. Parties $P_1$ and $P_n$
  may open a channel $(P_1, P_n)$ between them directly on-chain, in which case
  they follow an opening procedure like that of LN; such a channel is called
  \emph{simple}.
  Otherwise they can open it on top of a path
  of preexisting \emph{base} channels $(P_1, P_2)$, $(P_2, P_3)$, $\dots$,
  $(P_{n-1}, P_{n})$. Then $(P_1, P_n)$ is a \emph{virtual}
  channel. A channel is either simple or virtual, not both. Elmo is
  recursive, thus each base channel may itself be simple or
  virtual. To open a virtual
  channel, all parties on the
  path set aside funds in their channels as
  collateral; to do this
  they create $O(n^3)$ so-called \emph{virtual} transactions (txs) that essentially
  tie the spending of two adjacent base channels into a single atomic action.
  Once intermediaries are done, they have created a special \emph{funding}
  output off-chain with the sum of $P_1$ and $P_n$'s channel
  balance. $P_1$ and $P_n$
  finally create the channel, applying the logic of simple channels on top of
  the funding output: their channel is now open. LN demands that the funding
  output is on-chain, but we lift this requirement. We instead guarantee that
  either endpoint can put the funding output on-chain unilaterally.
  A payment over an established channel (described later for simple channels) follows a procedure inspired by
  LN.

  Parties $P_1, \dots, P_n$ can optimistically close a virtual channel
  fully off-chain. At a high
  level, parties controlling base channels \emph{revoke} their \emph{virtual}
  txs and the related \emph{commitment} txs, i.e., they cannot use them
  anymore. This effectively ``peels'' one \emph{virtualisation layer}.
  In the process, they redistribute coins so that intermediaries ``break even'',
  while $P_1$
  and $P_n$ get their rightful coins (as per the last channel
  state) in their base channels ($(P_1, P_2)$ and $(P_{n-1}, P_n)$ respectively).

  Finally, to unilaterally close a virtual channel $(P_1, P_n)$
  in case cooperation fails,
  either $P_1$ or $P_n$ sign and publish some
  txs on-chain. In the simplest case, $P_1$ publishes her virtual tx. This
  prompts $P_2$ to publish her
  virtual tx and so on up to $P_{n-1}$. The
  funding output of $(P_1, P_n)$ is then on-chain and closing can
  proceed as for simple channels. If instead any intermediary stays inactive, then a timelock
  expires turning an output into the funding output for $(P_1,
  P_n)$, at
  the expense of the inactive party. As discussed later, the funding output
  employs \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} so that the channel needs only a
  single commitment tx per endpoint, avoiding an exponential state blowup in the
  recursion depth and making off-chain payments efficient. We assume that
  parties already have established secure communication channels.
  In practice, peer discovery can be done as in LN.

  \textbf{In more detail,} during channel opening (Appx.~\ref{sec:protocol},
  Fig.~\ref{code:ln:open}) the two counterparties (i) create new signing keypairs and
  exchange the resulting public keys, then (ii) if the channel is
  virtual, prepare the underlying base channels, next (iii) they exchange
  signatures for their initial commitment txs
  and lastly, (iv) if the channel is simple, the \emph{funder} (who is the only
  party that provides coins for a new channel, like in LN) signs and publishes
  the \emph{funding} tx to the ledger.

  In order to build intuition, let us present examples of the
  lifecycles of a simple and a virtual channel. Consider $5$ parties, $A, B,
  \dots, E$ and $4$ channels, $(A, B)$, $\dots,(D, E)$, that will act as
  the base of the virtual channel $(A, E)$. We first follow the operations of
  the simple channel $(A, B)$ and then those of $(A, E)$. We simplify some parts
  of the protocol to aid comprehension --- see Appx.~\ref{sec:description} for
  more details.

  First $A$ and $B$ generate funding and revocation keypairs and exchange
  public keys ($A_F, B_F, A_R, B_R$ in Fig.~\ref{figure:payment-layer-simple} --
  $2$ messages). Each then
  locally generates the \emph{funding} and the two \emph{commitment} txs
  ($F, C_A$ in Fig.~\ref{figure:payment-layer-simple}). They
  sign $C_A$ and exchange the
  signatures ($2$ messages). $A$ stores her
  signed commitment tx off-chain and publishes $F$ on-chain. Once $F$
  is finalised, the channel is \emph{open}.

    $A_F$ is $A$'s funding key, $A_R$ her revocation key, $A \wedge B$ needs
    a signature by both $A$ and $B$. $A+t$ needs a signature

  The funding tx $F$ moves $A$'s initial coins to a \emph{$2$-of-$2$ multisig}, i.e., an
  output that needs signatures from $A_F$ and $B_F$ to be spent. There is one
  commitment tx per party, stored locally off-chain. The one held by $A$
  ($C_A$, Fig.~\ref{figure:payment-layer-simple}) spends $F$
  and has one output for $A$ (initially with all coins) and one for $B$
  (initially with $0$ coins). $A$'s output can be spent by either a multisig, or
  by $A$ after a \emph{relative timelock} of $t$ (relative means the countdown starts at the moment of
  publication). This is so
  that $B$ has time to \emph{punish} $A$ if she cheats. $B$'s commitment tx
  $C_B$ is symmetric. We recommend using $t = 5$ days as a default, the same as
  LN.

  When $A$ \emph{pays} $c$ coins to $B$, $A$ and $B$ create two new
  commitment txs.
  They have the same outputs and scripts as their previous ones, save for the
  coins: $A$'s outputs have $c$ coins less, $B$'s have $c$ more.
  They sign them and swap signatures. To ensure only one set of
  commitment txs is valid, they then revoke their previous ones by
  building and signing \emph{revocation} txs for the previous
  commitment txs. $B$'s revocation tx ($R_B$,
  Fig.~\ref{figure:payment-layer-simple}) gives $B$ all coins that belonged
  to $A$ and vice versa. This disincentivises both parties
  from publishing an old commitment tx under the threat of
  losing all their coins. A payment needs $3$ messages in total. Note
  that, after generating the new commitment txs and before revoking the old
  ones, each party has two valid commitments for different channel versions.
  This is fine, as the payment only concludes when revocation completes. If one
  party publishes the new commitment tx before revocation, then the
  other will consider the payment successful and vice versa for the old
  commitment tx.

  To unilaterally \emph{close} $(A, B)$, $A$ or $B$ publish the latest
  commitment tx on-chain and wait for timelock expiration. The last
  commitment tx is not revoked, thus punishment is impossible. Simple Elmo
  channels work like LN simplifed.

  Let channels $(A, B)$, $\dots,(D, E)$ be open and each ``left'' party own at
  least $c$ coins. Let us see how to open the virtual channel $(A, E)$ with $A$
  initially having $c$ coins using $(A, B)$, $\dots,(D, E)$ as base channels.
  Each base channel may be simple or virtual. If any one is virtual, then $(A,
  E)$ is recursive. Thanks to the similarity of all layers, the description
  below is identical in both cases. First, the $5$ parties generate and exchange
  a number of new
  keys, i.e., all keys that appear in the outputs of
  Figs.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-initiator-simple}--\ref{figure:virtual-layer-merge-intervals-simple}. Then
  each base pair removes $c$ coins from the ``left'' party in
  their base channel. The updated commitment txs use some of the new
  keys for the multisig in their input, since, as we will see, so-called \emph{virtual}
  txs will stand between the funding and the commitment txs from now on. These
  virtual txs will form the \emph{virtual layer} (Fig.~\ref{figure:example-start-end-simple}).

  Next, parties generate and sign these virtual txs and exchange the signatures.
  These txs form
  Elmo's core. Intuitively, they force each intermediary to interact with both of its
  base channels instead of one at a time, so that virtual channel information
  flows along the base channels. There are $3$ virtual
  tx types -- looking ahead, we explain them based on how they help
  close the channel on-chain. The \emph{initiator} virtual tx spends the two funding outputs of an
  intermediary (say $D$) and needs to be signed by $C_F$, $D_F$, and $E_F$.
  It has $4$ outputs: one new funding
  output for each of $(C, D)$ and $(D, E)$
  (Fig.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-initiator-simple}, top \& bottom outputs), one
  output that refunds the collateral to $D$ ($2$nd from top) and,
  crucially, a so-called \emph{virtual} output ($3$rd from top). The latter
  can be spent by $C$ by the top input of an \emph{extend-interval} tx, the second type of virtual
  tx (Fig.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-extend-interval-simple}). It needs
  signatures from the \emph{virtual keys} $A_V \dots E_V$ of all parties. This
  tx also spends the other $C$'s funding output, namely that of $(B,C)$ (bottom
  input). It has $3$ outputs: one refunding the collateral to $C$
  (top), another virtual output (middle), and a funding output that replaces the
  one just spent (bottom). In our example, $A$ also uses its initiator tx
  (Fig.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-endpoint-simple}). The format of an endpoint's
  initiator tx is different. It spends only the funding output of
  $(A, B)$ and produces $2$ outputs: a new funding output for $(A, B)$ (top) and
  a virtual output (bottom) -- this is the only virtual tx $A$ stores. $B$ can in
  turn spend $A$'s and $C$'s virtual outputs with a
  \emph{merge-intervals} tx
  (Fig.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-merge-intervals-simple}), the last virtual tx
  type, which also needs signatures from $A_V \dots E_V$. It has $2$ outputs: one refunds $B$ and
  the other produces a new virtual
  output. Now
  all base funding outputs are spent, all intermediaries are refunded and the
  virtual layer has ``collapsed''. Additionally, the
  virtual output of $B$'s tx plays the role of the funding output of the virtual
  channel $(A, E)$.

  The virtual txs have two properties: First, each intermediary can
  publish at most one virtual tx, which refunds its collateral
  exactly once. We will see how this is enforced below. Second, if the chain of
  virtual txs is at any point broken by
  an inactive intermediary that does not publish its virtual tx, the
  virtual channel will still be funded correctly and the inactive party will
  lose its collateral. This is because
  the unclaimed virtual output turns into the funding output of
  the virtual channel
  after a timelock, see, e.g., Fig.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-initiator-simple},
  output $3$, spending method $2$.

  Keys $A_b \dots E_b$
  (Figs.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-initiator-simple}--\ref{figure:virtual-layer-merge-intervals-simple}) can be
  spent by \emph{bridge} txs, the output of which funds $(A, E)$.
  Bridge txs allows endpoints to only store a single commitment tx instead of $O(n^3)$.
  Any virtual output may end up funding the virtual channel, but each
  virtual output has a different script, thus no single
  commitment tx is able to spend all of them. Bridge txs fix this by having the
  same output. This makes virtual channel updates as cheap as simple channel
  updates.

  Some considerations remain to ascertain the scheme's security.
  Firstly, if all virtual outputs
  were identical, an adversary could fabricate arbitrarily many virtual outputs using
  its own, external to the protocol, coins and publish a perpetual stream of
  merge-intervals txs that spend one valid and one fabricated virtual output.
  This would prevent an honest endpoint from accessing their funding output.
  We avoid this by
  specifying on each virtual output the exact sequence of parties that have
  already published a virtual tx and only allowing the parties at the two edges
  of the sequence
  to extend it with their virtual tx. If all intermediaries publish a virtual
  tx, then the last published one cannot be spent by
  another virtual
  tx. This ensures that the endpoints will eventually obtain a funding
  output, but needs intermediaries to store
  $O(n^2)$ virtual txs for a virtual channel over $n$ parties. Secondly,
  we have to carefully select the values of timelocks to ensure that
  each party has enough time to act. Timelocks increase linearly
  with the recursion depth. The exact values are shown in
  % acmart
  %Sec.~\ref{sec:pseudocode} and
  Appx.~\ref{sec:protocol}.

  We now return to the opening procedure. After the $5$ parties set up the virtual txs, they revoke their previous
  commitment
  txs. They do this by signing the relevant revocation txs, just like
  for a simple channel. It takes $12 \cdot (n-1)$ messages, i.e., $6$ messages
  per endpoint and $12$ messages per intermediary, to set up the virtual layer
  --- see Sec.~\ref{section:comparison} for more details.

    \caption{$4$ simple channels supporting a virtual one. $A$ and $D$ start
    closing by publishing their initiator virtual txs, then $C$ publishes its
    suitable extend-interval virtual tx, after which $B$ publishes its suitable
    merge-intervals virtual tx. No party stays inactive. The virtual
    transactions $A$--$D$ form the virtual layer. Virtual outputs are marked
    with the set (interval) of parties that have already published a tx.
    \emph{Bridge} txs like $b$ are used by $A$ and $E$ to convert the various
    virtual outputs into the same funding output, as \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} only
    works across identical outputs.}
    \label{figure:example-start-end-simple}
  \end{figure*}

  At last, the virtual layer is set up: Both $A$ and $E$ can unilaterally
  force a funding output for channel $(A, E)$ on-chain, no matter what the rest
  of the parties do. Likewise, honest intermediaries can
  unilaterally retrieve their funds.

  $A$ and $E$ finally exchange
  commitment transactions for their new channel, thus concluding its opening.
  $A$ and $E$ can pay each other over their virtual channel exactly like
  they would over a simple channel; we refer the reader to the relevant
  description above.

  Note that funding outputs use the \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} flag, thus ensuring
  that a single pair of commitment txs can spend any of the funding outputs. If
  \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} were not used, each virtual layer would need a copy of the
  entire set of discussed txs for each possible funding output of its base
  layer, resulting in exponential storage requirements. To make matters worse,
  a payment over $(A, E)$ would need $A$ and $E$ to renegotiate exponentially
  many commitment txs, as well as recalculate all their downstream txs, which
  would in turn need interaction with intermediaries of all virtual channels
  built over $(A, E)$, completely defeating the essence of payment channels.

  To enhance usability, our protocol enables closing the virtual channel
  off-chain if all parties cooperate. To do this, the endpoints first
  let the intermediaries know their final virtual channel balance. Then the
  parties of each base channel create new commitment txs for their channels,
  moving the collateral back into the channel: the ``left'' party gets $A$'s
  coins and the ``right'' one gets $E$'s. Thus all intermediaries ``break even''
  across their two channels. Once they do this, the parties revoke all virtual
  txs, using a logic similar to the revocation procedure of simple channels but
  scaled up to all parties. This is why all virtual tx outputs
  (Figs.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-initiator-simple}--\ref{figure:virtual-layer-merge-intervals-simple})
  have a spending method with $A_R \dots E_R$ keys.

  What if one party does not cooperate? Then one or more of the other parties must close
  unilaterally on-chain. Fig.~\ref{figure:example-start-end-simple} shows how
  this would play out if $A$ and $D$ initiated this procedure.

  Our protocol is recursive because both simple and virtual channels are
  ultimately represented by a funding output that either already is or can be put
  on-chain, therefore new virtual channels can be built on either.
  Both simple and virtual channels avoid key reuse on-chain, thus ensuring party
  privacy from on-chain observers. See Appx.~\ref{sec:pseudocode} for the
  protocol pseudocode and Appx.~\ref{sec:construction} for more
  details.
