\section{High Level Explanation}
  Conceptually, our protocol is split into three main actions: channel opening,
  payments and closing. A channel between $P_1$ and $P_n$ may be opened directly
  on-chain, in which case the two parties follow a modified Lightning opening
  procedure, or it can be opened on top of a path of preexisting channels
  established between parties $(P_2, P_3), (P_3, P_4), \dots, (P_{n-3},
  P_{n-2}), (P_{n-2}, P_{n-1})$. In this case all parties $P_i$ on the path
  follow our novel protocol as discussed below in more detail, locking funds in
  their channels as collateral for the virtual channel being opened. Once all
  intermediaries are committed, $P_1$ and $P_n$ finally create (and keep
  off-chain) their funding transaction, following a logic similar to Lightning.

  A payment over an established channel follows a procedure heavily inspired by
  Lightning, but without the use of HTLCs. In particular \TODO{}.

  Finally, the closing procedure can be completed unilaterally and consists of
  signing and publishing a number of transactions on-chain. As we will discuss
  later, the exact transactions that a party will publish vary depending on the
  exact actions of the other on-path parties. Our protocol can be augmented with
  a more efficient optimistic collaborative closing procedure, which however is
  left as future work.
