 The first proposal for PCNs was due to~\cite{spilman} which only enabled
 unidirectional payment channels. As mentioned previously, DMCs~\cite{decker}
 with their decrementing timelocks have the shortcoming of limited channel
 lifetime. This was ameliorated by LN~\cite{lightning} which has become the dominant paradigm for designing PCNs for Bitcoin-compatible systems. 
 LN is currently implemented and operational for
  Bitcoin. It has also been adapted for Ethereum~\cite{wood2014ethereum}, where
  it is known as the Raiden Network~\cite{raiden}.

A number of attacks have been identified against LN. The wormhole
  attack~\cite{DBLP:conf/ndss/MalavoltaMSKM19} against LN allows
  colluding parties in a multi-hop payment to steal the fees of the
  intermediaries between them and Flood \& Loot attacks~\cite{10.1145/3419614.3423248}
  analyses the feasibility of an attack in which too many channels are forced to
  close in a short amount of time, reducing the blockchain liveness and enabling
  a malicious party to steal off-chain funds.

  To the best of our knowledge, no formal treatment of the privacy of LN exists.
  Nevertheless, it intuitively improves upon the privacy of on-chain Bitcoin
  transactions, as LN payments do not leave a permanent record: only
  intermediaries of each payment are informed. It can be argued that Elmo
  further improves privacy, as individual payments are completely hidden from
  the intermediaries of a virtual channel.

  Payment routing~\cite{spider,prihodko2016flare,lee2020routee} is another research area that aims to improve the network efficiency without sacrificing  privacy. Actively rebalancing channels~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/KhalilG17} can
  further increase network efficiency by preventing routes from becoming   unavailable due to lack of well-balanced funds.

  An alternantive payment channel construction that aspires to be the successor
  of Lightning is eltoo~\cite{eltoo}. It has a conceptually simpler
  construction, smaller on-chain footprint and a more forgiving attitude towards
  submitting an old channel state than Lightning, but it needs the
  \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} sighash flag to be added to Bitcoin. In comparison to
  Elmo, eltoo is more lightweight in terms of storage and communication when
  setting up, but suffers from increased latency and communication when payments
  are performed, as intermediaries have to actively participate in multi-hop
  payments. It also suffers in terms of privacy, as intermediaries learn the
  exact time and value of each payment.

  Bolt~\cite{10.1145/3133956.3134093} constructs privacy-preserving payment
  channels enabling both direct payments and payments with a single untrusted
  intermediary. Sprites~\cite{sprites} leverages the scripting language of
  Ethereum to decrease the time collateral is locked up compared to Lightning.

  State channels are a generalisation of payment channels, which enable
  off-chain execution of any smart contract supported by the underlying
  blockchain, not just payments. Generalized Bitcoin-Compatible
  Channels~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/AumayrEEFHMMR20} enable the creation of
  state channels on Bitcoin, extending channel functionality from simple
  payments to arbitrary Bitcoin scripts. State channels can also be extended to
  more than two
  parties~\cite{DBLP:conf/asiaccs/LiaoZSS22,DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/DziembowskiEFHH19}.

  Perun~\cite{perun} and GSCN~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/DziembowskiFH18} exploit the
  Turing-complete scripting language of Ethereum to provide virtual state
  channels, i.e.\ state channels that can open without an on-chain transaction.
  Similar features are provided by Celer~\cite{dong2018celer}.
  Hydra~\cite{cryptoeprint:2020:299} provides state channels for the
  Cardano~\cite{cardano} blockchain which combines a UTXO type of model with
  general purpose smart contract functionality that are also isomorphic, i.e.\
  Hydra channels can accommodate any script that is compatible with the
  underlying blockchain.

  BDW~\cite{scalable-funding} shows how pairwise channels over Bitcoin can be
  funded with no on-chain transactions by allowing parties to form groups that
  can pool their funds together off-chain and then use those funds to open
  channels. Such proposals are complementary to virtual channels and, depending
  on the usecase, could be more efficient. In comparison to Elmo, BDW is
  flexible: any coins in a BDW pool can only be exchanged with members of that
  pool. ACMU~\cite{10.1145/3319535.3345666} allows for multi-path atomic
  payments with reduced collateral, enabling new applications such as
  crowdfunding conditional on reaching a funding target.

  TEE-based~\cite{zhao2019sok}
solutions~\cite{teechan,10.1145/3341301.3359627,liao2021speedster,lee2020routee}
  improve the throughput and efficiency of PCNs by an order of magnitude or
  more, at the cost of having to trust TEEs. Brick~\cite{avarikioti2020brick}
  uses a partially trusted committee to extend PCNs to fully asynchronous
  networks.

  Solutions alternative to PCNs include 
side\-chains (e.g.,~\cite{BCDF+14,sidechains,KiaZin18}),
non-custo\-dial chains (e.g.,~\cite{plasma,konstantopoulos2019plasma,plasma-lower-bounds,rollup}),
  and partially centralised payment networks that entirely avoid using a blockchain~\cite{DBLP:conf/trust/ArmknechtKMYZ15,stellar,silentwhispers,DBLP:conf/ndss/RoosMKG18}. 

  Last but not least, a number of works propose virtual channel constructions
  for Bitcoin. Lightweight Virtual Payment
  Channels~\cite{10.1007/978-3-030-65411-5_18} enables a virtual channel to be
  opened on top of two preexisting channels and uses a technique similar to DMC,
  unfortunately inheriting the fixed lifetime limitation.
  Let ``simple channels'' be those built directly on-chain, i.e.\ channels that are not
  virtual.
  Bitcoin-Compatible Virtual Channels~\cite{9519487} also enables
  virtual channels on top of two preexisting simple channels
  and offers two protocols, the first of which guarantees that the channel will
  stay off-chain for an agreed period, while the second allows the single intermediary
  to turn the virtual into a simple channel.
  This strategy has the shortcoming that even if it is made
  recursive (a direction left open in~\cite{9519487}) after $k$
  applications of the constructor the virtual channel participant will have to
  publish on-chain $k$ transactions in order to close the channel if all
  intermediaries actively monitor the blockchain.

  Furthermore, Donner~\cite{donner} is the first work to achieve variadic
  virtual channels without the need for recursion nor features that are not yet
  available in Bitcoin. This is achieved by having the funder use funds that are
  external to the ``base channels'' (i.e.\ the channels that the virtual channel
  is based on), so a party that has all its coins in channels cannot fund a
  Donner channel; additionally, we conjecture that using external coins
  precludes variadic virtual channel designs that are not encumbered with
  limited lifetime. Furthermore, due to its incentive structure, all of the
  base channels are forced to close if the virtual channel is closed.
  Donner also relies on placeholder outputs
  which, due to the minimum coins they need to carry to exceed Bitcoin's ``dust
  limit'', may skew the incentives of rational players and adds to the
  opportunity cost of maintaining a channel. Furthermore, its design complicates
  future iterations that lift its current restriction that only one of the two
  channel parties can fund the virtual channel. Donner is more efficient than
  Elmo in terms of storage, computation and communication
  complexity, and boasts a simpler design, but has less room for optimisations
  and is not recursive.

  We refer the reader to Table~\ref{table:comparison-features} for a comparison of the
  features and limitations of virtual channel protocols, including the one put
  forth in the current work.
