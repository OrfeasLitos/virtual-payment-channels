      \State On receiving (\texttt{in\_msg}, $P$) by \fchan,
      handle (\texttt{in\_msg}) with the simulated party $P$,
      initialising it as an \textsc{ln} ITI if it does not exist yet. Any
      resulting message \texttt{out\_msg} that should be provided to $R$ by
      means of $\texttt{mode} \in$ \{input, output, network\} is relayed to
      \fchan as (\texttt{out\_msg}, $P$, $R$, \texttt{mode}).
      \Statex

      \State On receiving by \fchan a message to be sent by $P$ to $R$ via the
      network, carry on with this action (i.e. send this message via the
      internal \adversary). \Comment{This message was previously designated to
      be sent by our internally simulated $P$ to $R$ via the network.}
    \end{algorithmic}

    As \fchan relays all messages by \environment to us, our simulation is
    trivially identical to what would happen in the real world.
