In order to generate random payments for uniform distribution and zipf distribution run simulation.py
In order to generate random payments for preferred receiver scenario run simulation_preferred_receiver.py
If you want to change the number of parties or another parameter of the random payments change it in all_random_payments or all_random_payments_preferred_receiver.
You can also change the seed in the main.

To run the simulations choose your payment_method "method" (e.g. "donner") and the scenario "scenario" (e.g. power_law) and run simulation_scenario_method.py (e.g. simulation_power_law_donner.py).
The results will be in pickle files and you can open them as in "make_graphs.py".
