Perun~\cite{perun} and GSCN~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/DziembowskiFH18} exploit the
  Turing-complete scripting language of Ethereum to provide virtual state
  channels.
  GSCN also uses a per-channel functionality and a similar recursive argument
  as we use in our UC-security analysis. Their security argument is however
  flawed, as they incorrectly argue that every level is subroutine respecting
  with respect to the same environment and subroutines.
  We believe that, given the versatile scripting of Ethereum, GSCN could be
  straightforwardly extended to support variadic channels. 
  A number of works propose virtual channel constructions
  for Bitcoin. LVPC~\cite{10.1007/978-3-030-65411-5_18} enables a virtual channel to be
  opened on top of two preexisting channels and uses a technique similar to DMC,
  unfortunately inheriting the fixed lifetime limitation.
  Let \emph{simple channels} be those built directly on-chain, i.e., channels that are not
  virtual.
  Bitcoin-Compatible Virtual Channels~\cite{9519487} enables
  virtual channels on top of two preexisting simple channels
  and offers two protocols, the first of which guarantees that the channel will
  stay off-chain for an agreed period, while the second allows the single intermediary
  to turn the virtual into a simple channel.
  This strategy has the shortcoming that even if it is made
  recursive (a direction left open in~\cite{9519487}) after $k$
  applications of the constructor the virtual channel participant will have to
  publish on-chain $k$ transactions in order to close the channel if all
  intermediaries actively monitor the blockchain.

  Donner~\cite{donner}
    (released originally concurrently with the first technical report of Elmo) 
%  is the first work

also achieves variadic
  virtual channels but without recursive ones. This is
  done by having the funder lock as
  collateral twice the amount of the desired channel funds: once on-chain with
  funds that are external to the \emph{base channels} (i.e., the channels that the
  virtual channel is based on) and once off-chain within its base channel. Thus
  the required collateral for the funder is double that of other protocols;
  additionally, we conjecture that using external coins precludes variadic
  virtual channels with unlimited lifetime. This
  design choice further means that Donner is not symmetric. Donner also uses
  placeholder outputs which, due to the minimum coins they need to
  exceed Bitcoin's \emph{dust limit}, may skew the incentives of rational players
  and adds to the channel
  opportunity cost. The aforementioned incentives
  together with its lack of recursiveness mean that if a party with coins in a
  Donner channel decides to use them with another party, it first has to close
  its channel either off-chain, which needs cooperation of all base parties, or
  else on-chain, with all the delays and fees this entails.
  Further, its design complicates
  future iterations that lift its current restriction that only one of the two
  channel parties can fund the virtual channel. On the positive side, Donner is
  more efficient than Elmo in terms of storage, computation and communication
  complexity, and boasts a simpler design. 
  %, but has less room for optimisations and is not recursive. 
  Their work also introduces the \emph{Domino attack},
  which we adress in Section~\ref{sec:future-work}.
