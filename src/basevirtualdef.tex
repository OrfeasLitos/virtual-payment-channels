\begin{definition}[Base channel] \ \\
  A {\em base channel} sends exactly one \textsc{submit} message to \ledger{}
  during the execution of \texttt{openChannel} and one more during
  \texttt{closeChannel}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Virtual channel] \ \\
  A {\em virtual channel} does not send any \textsc{submit} message to \ledger{}
  during the execution of \texttt{openChannel}. Furthermore, if all
  participating parties in all implicated base channel functionalities are
  honest, a virtual channel does not send any \textsc{submit} message to
  \ledger{} during the execution of \texttt{closeChannel} either, whereas in
  case one party is dishonest it sends at most one such message.
\end{definition}
