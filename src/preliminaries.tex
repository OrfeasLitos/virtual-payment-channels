\section{Model}

  \subsection{\ledger Functionality}
  In this work we embrace the Universal Composition (UC) framework~\cite{uc}
  together with its global subroutines extension,
  UCGS~\cite{DBLP:conf/tcc/BadertscherCHTZ20}, to
  model parties, network interactions, adversarial influence and corruptions, as
  well as formalise and prove security --- more details on UC in
  Appx.~\ref{sec:uc}. We model the Bitcoin ledger with the \ledger
  functionality as defined in~\cite{BMTZ17,genesis}. \ledger formalizes an ideal
  data structure that is
  distributed and append-only, akin to a blockchain. Participants can read from
  \ledger, which returns an ordered list of transactions. Additionally a party
  can submit a new transaction which, if valid, will eventually be added to the
  ledger when the adversary decides, but necessarily within a predefined time
  window. This property is named liveness. Once a transaction becomes part of
  the ledger, it then becomes visible to all parties at the discretion of the
  adversary, but necessarily within another predefined time window, and it
  cannot be reordered or removed. This is named persistence.

  Moreover, \ledger needs the \Fclock
  functionality~\cite{DBLP:conf/tcc/KatzMTZ13}, which models the notion of time.
  Any \Fclock participant can request to read the current time and inform \Fclock that her round is over. \Fclock increments the
  time by one once all parties have declared the end of their round. Both
  \ledger and \Fclock are global
  functionalities~\cite{DBLP:conf/tcc/BadertscherCHTZ20} and therefore can be
  accessed directly by the environment. The definitions of \ledger and \Fclock
  can be found in Appx.~\ref{subsec:ledger}.

  \subsection{Modelling time}
  The protocol (\pchan) and functionality (\fchan) defined in this work do not use \Fclock
  directly. The only notion of time is provided by the
  blockchain height, as reported by \ledger. We thus omit it in
  our lemmas and theorems statements to simplify notation; it should
  normally appear as a hybrid together with \ledger.

  Our protocol does not impose any additional synchrony assumptions beyond what
  is needed by the underlying blockchain, i.e., the adversary can delay protocol
  messages arbitrarily long. The protocol is robust against such delays, as an
  honest party can unilaterally prevent loss of funds even if some of its
  messages are dropped by \adversary, given that
  the party can communicate with \ledger. In other words, no
  extra synchrony assumptions to those required by \ledger are needed. We
  also note that,
  following the conventions of single-threaded UC execution model, the duration of local
  computation is not taken into account (as long as it does not
  exceed its polynomial bound).
