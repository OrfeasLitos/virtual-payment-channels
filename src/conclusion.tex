\section{Conclusion}

  In this work we presented Recursive Virtual Payment Channels for Bitcoin, a
  construction which enables the establishment and optimistic teardown of
  pairwise payment channels without the need for posting on-chain transactions.
  Such a channel can be opened over a path of consecutive base channels of
  arbitrary length, i.e., the virtual channel constructor is variadic.

  The base channels themselves can be virtual, therefore the novel recursive
  nature of the construction. A key performance characteristic of our
  construction is that it has optimal round complexity for on-chain channel
  closing: a single transaction is required by any participant to turn the
  virtual channel into a simple one and one more transaction is needed to close
  it, be it an end-point or an intermediary. The two transactions can be
  submitted simultaneously.

  We formally described the protocol in the UC setting, provided a corresponding
  ideal functionality and simulator and finally proved the indistinguishability
  of the protocol and functionality, along with the balance security properties
  that ensure no loss of funds for honest, non-negligent parties. This is
  achieved through the use of the \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} sighash flag, which is a
  proposed feature for Bitcoin, also required by the eltoo improvement to
  lightning~\cite{eltoo}.
