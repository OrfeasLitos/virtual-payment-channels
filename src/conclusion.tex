\section{Conclusion}

  In this work we presented Elmo, a
  construction for the establishment and optimistic teardown of
  payment channels without posting transactions on-chain.
  Such a virtual channel can be opened over a path of base channels of
  any length, i.e., the constructor is \emph{variadic}.

  The base channels themselves can be virtual, therefore our construction is
  \emph{recursive}. A key performance characteristic of our
  protocol is its optimal round complexity for on-chain channel
  closing: one transaction is required by any party to turn the
  virtual channel into a simple one and one more transaction is needed to close
  it.

  We formally described the protocol in the UC setting, provided a suitable
  ideal functionality and finally proved the indistinguishability
  of the protocol and functionality, along with the balance security properties
  that ensure no loss of funds. This is
  achieved through the use of the \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} sighash flag, which is a
  feature that will likely be added in the next Bitcoin update.
