In~\cite{donner} the Domino attack is presented. Briefly, it claims that a
malicious virtual channel party can force other channels to close. To
illustrate this, suppose $A$ and $E$ of
Fig.~\ref{figure:example-start-end-simple} open
channels
$(A, B)$, $(D, E)$ and $(A, E)$ with the intent of forcing channels $(B,
C)$ and $(C, D)$ to close. Contrary to the attack goal, honest
base parties are only
forced to publish a single virtual tx each, which places their funding
outputs on-chain but does not cause the base channels to close. There is still a
small downside:
the channel capacity is reduced by the collateral, which
is paid directly to one of the two base channel parties. Since no coins are
stolen, the only cost to $B$, $C$ and $D$ is the on-chain fees
of one tx. This is an inherent but small risk of
recursive channels, which must be taken into account when making one's
channel the base of another. This risk can be eliminated by making an attacker
pay the fees for the others' on-chain txs. This fee need not apply in
case of cooperative closing nor
during normal operation and can be reduced for reputable parties.
Suitable reputation systems, as well as mechanisms for assigning inactivity
blame (i.e., proving which parties tried collaborative closing before
closing unilaterally), which are needed to determine who must pay the fees,
can be designed but are beyond the scope of this work.

A possible solution to
the recuded channel capacity is discussed in Appx.~\ref{sec:domino-prevention}.

%Furthermore, a simple modification to Elmo eliminates the channel capacity
%reduction under a Domino attack, while also reducing the on-chain
%cost of unilateral closing: from each virtual tx, we
%eliminate the output that directly
%pays a party (e.g., $1$st output of
%Fig.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-extend-interval-simple}) and move its coins into
%the funding output of this transaction (e.g., $3$rd
%output of Fig.~\ref{figure:virtual-layer-extend-interval-simple}). We further
%ensure at the protocol level that the base party that owns these coins never
%allows its channel balance to fall below the collateral, until the supported
%virtual channel closes. This change ensures that the collateral
%automatically becomes available to use in the base channel after the virtual one
%closes, keeping more funds off-chain after a Domino attack. This approach
%however has the drawback that, depending on which of the two parties first
%spends the funding output (with a virtual tx), the funds allocation in the
%channel differs. Base parties thus would have to maintain two sets of commitment
%and revocation txs, one for each case. Since this overhead encumbers the
%optimistic, cooperative case and only confers advantages in the pessimistic
%case, we choose not to adopt this approach into our design.

Further usability enhancements are possible: Firstly, we can support many
virtual channels in the same virtual layer, reducing on-chain and timelock
demands. Also, the maximum time between activations can be turned from the
currently global constant into a per-channel configurable parameter. Next,
various non-malicious mishaps such as dropped messages can be handled without
causing unilateral channel closure. What is more, LN features like one-off
multi-hop payments and cooperative on-chain closing of simple channels can be
easily incorporated. Lastly, an explicit fee system is needed. Periodic payments
by the endpoints to the intermediares can compensate for the opportunity cost of
the collateral for the latter. For additional future work, see
Appx.~\ref{sec:extra-future-work}.

% arcmart
%  A number of features can be added to our protocol for additional efficiency,
%  usability and flexibility. First of all, in our current construction, each
%  time a particular channel $C$ acts as a base
%  channel for a new virtual channel, one more ``virtualisation layer'' is added. When
%  one of its owners wants to close $C$, it has to put on-chain as many
%  transactions as there are virtualisation layers. Also the timelocks associated
%  with closing a virtual channel increase with the number of virtualisation
%  layers of its base channels. Both these issues can be alleviated by extending
%  the opening and cooperative closing subprotocol with the ability to
%  cooperatively open and close multiple virtual channels in the same layer,
%  either simultaneously or by amending an existing virtualisation layer.
%
%  In this work a channel can be funded by only one of the two endpoints.
%  This limitation simplifies the execution model and analysis, but can be lifted
%  at the cost of additional protocol complexity.
%
%  Furthermore, as it currently stands, the
%  timelocks calculated for the virtual channels are based on $p$
%  (Figure~\ref{code:ln:init}) and $s$ (Figure~\ref{code:ln:exchange-open-sigs}),
%  which are global constants that are immutable and common to all parties. The
%  parameter $s$ stems from the liveness guarantees of Bitcoin, as discussed in
%  Proposition~\ref{prop:liveness} (Appx.~\ref{subsec:liveness}) and therefore cannot be tweaked. However, $p$
%  represents the maximum time (in blocks) between two activations of a
%  non-negligent party, so in principle it is possible for the parties to
%  explicitly negotiate this value when opening a new channel and even
%  renegotiate it after the channel has been opened if the counterparties agree.
%  We leave this usability-augmenting protocol feature as future work.
%
%  Our protocol is not designed to ``gracefully'' recover from a situation in
%  which halfway through a subprotocol, one of the counterparties starts
%  misbehaving. Currently the only solution is to unilaterally close the channel.
%  This however means that DoS attacks (that still do not lead to channel fund
%  losses) are possible. A practical implementation of our protocol would need to
%  expand the available actions and states to be able to transparently and
%  gracefully recover from such problems, avoiding closing the channel where
%  possible, especially when the problem stems from network issues and not from
%  malicious behaviour.
%
%  Additionally, our protocol does not feature one-off multi-hop payments like
%  those possible in Lightning. This however is a useful feature in case two
%  parties know that they will only transact once, as opening a virtual channel
%  needs substantially more network communication than performing an one-off
%  multi-hop payment. It would be therefore fruitful to also enable the multi-hop
%  payment technique and allow human users to choose which method to use in each
%  case. Likewise, optimistic cooperative on-chain closing of simple channels
%  could be done just like in Lightning, obviating the need to wait for the
%  revocation timelock to expire and reducing on-chain costs if the counterparty
%  is cooperative.
%
%  What is more, any deployment of the protocol has to explicitly handle the issue
%  of tx fees. These include miner fees for on-chain txs and
%  intermediary fees for the parties that own base channels and facilitate
%  opening virtual channels. These fees should take into account the fact that
%  each intermediary has quadratic storage requirements, whereas endpoints only
%  need constant storage, creating an opportunity for amplification attacks.
%  Additionally, a fee structure that takes into account the opportunity cost of
%  base parties locking collateral for a potentially long time is needed. A
%  straightforward mechanism is for parties to agree on a time-based fee schedule
%  and periodically update their base channels to reflect contingent payments by
%  the endpoints. We leave the relevant incentive analysis as future work.
%
%  In order to increase readability and to keep focus on the salient points of
%  the construction, our protocol does not exploit various possible
%  optimisations. These include allowing parties to stay offline for
%  longer~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/AumayrTMMM22}, and some techniques employed in Lightning that
%  drastically reduce storage requirements, such as storage of per-update secrets
%  in $O(\log n)$
%  space\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md\#efficient-per-commitment-secret-storage}},
%  and other improvements to our novel virtual subprotocol.
%
%  As mentioned before, we make two conjectures: The first is that a variadic
%  virtual channel protocol with unlimited lifetime is impossible if the locking
%  of external on-chain coins is used, as is done in Donner~\cite{donner}. The
%  second conjecture is that, given today's Bitcoin which does not have
%  \texttt{ANYPREVOUT}, there is no off-chain virtual channel constructor that
%  offers a closing operation with $O(1)$ on-chain transactions, has parties
%  locally store the channel state as transactions and signatures, does not
%  require locking of external on-chain coins, and does not require each party to
%  invest an exponential storage space. We
%  leave proof of these conjectures as future work. Furthermore, the formal verification of
%  the UC security proof is deferred to such a time when a practical framework
%  for mechanised UC proofs becomes available.
%
%  Last but not least, the current analysis gives no privacy guarantees for the
%  protocol, as it does not employ onion packets~\cite{sphinx} like Lightning.
%  Furthermore, \fchan leaks all messages to the ideal adversary therefore
%  theoretically no privacy is offered at all. Nevertheless, onion packets can be
%  incorporated in the current construction. Intuitively our construction
%  leaks less data than Lightning for the same multi-hop payments, as
%  intermediaries in our case are not notified on each payment, contrary to
%  multi-hop payments in Lightning. Therefore a future extension can improve the
%  privacy of the construction and formally demonstrate exact privacy guarantees.
