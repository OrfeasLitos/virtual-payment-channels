\TODO{make the proof work (possibly by adding another lemma that bridges Lemma 2
with the check succeeding)}
\begin{lemma}[No halt]
  In an ideal execution with \fchan and \simulator, the functionality never
  halts (i.e. l.~\ref{code:functionality:state-machine-2:halt} of
  Fig.~\ref{code:functionality:state-machine-2} is never executed).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  This Lemma is a direct consequence of applying
  Lemmas~\ref{lemma:real-balance-security} and~\ref{lemma:ideal-balance} to both
  parties of \fchan, along with the fact that the description of \fchan and
  \simulator ensure that \simulator simulates internally an exact replica of the
  execution of the machines that would run in the real world, therefore
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:real-balance-security} applies to the simulated parties and
  by extension to the transactions that appear in \ledger in the ideal world.
\end{proof}
