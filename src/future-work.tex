\section{Future work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add support for cooperative adding multiple virtuals to single channel
    as future work (needs cooperation by all hops of all existing virtuals of
    current channel)
    \item Add support for cooperative closing as future work
    \item Use eltoo instead of lightning as future work to avoid balance
    restriction that prevents the revoked-griefing attack
  \end{itemize}
