Both \pchan and \fchan are parametrized by the stateful processes \textsc{pcn}
(payment channel network) and \textsc{virt} (virtual layer).
\TODO{if the 2 processes share too much state, merge into 1 process}

If:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \pchan (\fchan) is activated by \environment ($\dave \in \{\alice,
  \bob\}$),
  \item \pchan (\fchan) then calls a method of either process (expecting some
  value to be returned by it),
  \item and subsequently the method gives up the execution token to another ITI
  (before it returns),
\end{itemize}
then \pchan (\fchan) repeatedly relays any input by \environment (\dave) to the
method until the latter returns.
