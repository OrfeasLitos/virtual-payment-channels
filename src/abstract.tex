  Blockchains are slow. Layer-2 largely solves this problem. PCNs constitute the
  most prominent layer-2/off-chain protocols. LN is the most widely used PCN and
  works on Bitcoin. Opening a channel requires 1 on-chain transaction, which can
  at times be avoided by performing a multi-hop payment. Then however fees to
  the intermediaries must be paid, routing becomes an issue, payment
  delay is proportional to the number of intermediaries and per-payment privacy
  suffers.

  We propose Recursive Channels, which allow for new channels to be opened on
  top of an arbitrarily long path of existing channels in a recursive manner
  (i.e. the preexisting channels may themselves be virtual), answering the
  question of feasibility in the affirmative.

  Our construction relies on the proposed \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} signature type.
