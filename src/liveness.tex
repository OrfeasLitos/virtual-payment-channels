\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:liveness}
  Consider a synchronised honest party that submits a transaction \tx to the
  ledger functionality~\cite{genesis} by the time the block indexed by $h$ is
  added to $\texttt{state}$ in its view. Then \tx is guaranteed to be included
  in the block range $[h+1, h + s]$, where $s = (2 + q) \windowSize$ and $q = \lceil
  (\maxTime + \frac{\vdelay}{2})/ \minTime \rceil$.

  Consider $\tau^{\stkh}_h$ to be the round that a party $\stkh$ becomes aware
  of the $h$-th block in the $\texttt{state}$. It follows that $\tau_h \leq
  \tau^{\stkh}_h$ where $\tau_h$ is the round block $h$ enters $\texttt{state}$. Note
  that by time $\tau_h + \maxTime$ another $\windowSize$ blocks are added to
  $\texttt{state}$ and thus $\tau^{\stkh}_h \leq \tau_h + \maxTime$.

  Suppose $\stkh$ submits the transaction $\tx$ to the ledger at time
  $\tau^{\stkh}_h$. Observe that as long as $\tau_h + \maxTime$ is $\vdelay/2$
  before the time that block with index $h + t - 2\windowSize$ enters $\texttt{state}$,
  then $\tx$ is guaranteed to enter the $\texttt{state}$ in a block with index up to $h
  + t$ where since $\advBlocksinWindowSize < \windowSize$. It follows we need
  $\tau_h + \maxTime < \tau_{h + t - 2\windowSize} - \frac{\vdelay}{2}$. Let $r
  = \lceil (\maxTime + \frac{\vdelay}{2})/ \minTime \rceil$. Recall that in a
  period of $\minTime$ rounds at most $\windowSize$ blocks enter $\texttt{state}$. As a
  result $r \cdot \windowSize$ blocks require at least $r \cdot \minTime \geq
  \maxTime + \frac{\vdelay}{2}$ rounds. We deduce that if $t \geq (2 +
  r)\windowSize$ the inequality follows.
