\section{Future work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add support for cooperative adding multiple virtuals to single channel
    (needs cooperation by all hops of all existing virtuals of current channel)
    \item Add support for cooperative closing
    \item Use eltoo instead of lightning to avoid balance restriction that
    prevents the revoked-griefing attack
    \item Allow for user-defined ``leeway'' timeout and timeout renegotiation
    \item Incorporate fees
    \item Prevent DoS attacks
    \item Improve privacy (mention full \fchan leakage)
    \item Integrate with Lightning (i.e. allow both HTLC multi-hop payments
    \emph{and} virtual channels
  \end{itemize}
