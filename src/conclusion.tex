\section{Conclusion}
  In this work we presented Recursive Virtual Payment Channels for Bitcoin,
  which enable the establishment of pairwise payment channels with zero on-chain
  transactions. Such a channel can be opened over a path of consecutive base
  channels of arbitrary length. The base channels themselves can be virtual,
  therefore the novel recursive nature of the construction. We formally
  described the protocol in the UC setting, provided a corresponding ideal
  functionality and simulator and finally proved the indistinguishability of the
  protocol and functionality, along with the balance security property that
  ensures no loss of funds for honest, non-negligent parties. This is achieved
  through the use of the \texttt{ANYPREVOUT} sighash flag, which is a proposed
  feature for Bitcoin. We conjecture that no construction can achieve similar
  features without this sighash flag and we believe that this work serves as
  further evidence for the usefulness of including this flag in Bitcoin in the
  future.
