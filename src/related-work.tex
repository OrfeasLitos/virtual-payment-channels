 The first proposal for PCNs~\cite{spilman} only enabled
 unidirectional payment channels. As mentioned previously, DMCs~\cite{decker}
 with their decrementing timelocks have the shortcoming of limited channel
 lifetime. This was ameliorated by LN~\cite{lightning} which has become the dominant paradigm for designing Bitcoin-compatible PCNs.
 LN is currently implemented and operational for
  Bitcoin. It has also been adapted for Ethereum, named
  Raiden Network. Compared to Elmo, LN is more lightweight in terms of
  storage and communication when setting up, but suffers from increased latency
  and communication for payments, as intermediaries have to actively participate
  in multi-hop payments. Its privacy also suffers, as intermediaries
  learn the exact time and value of each payment.

  An alternative payment channel system for Bitcoin that aspires to
  succeed LN is eltoo~\cite{eltoo}. It is conceptually simpler,
  has smaller on-chain footprint and a more forgiving attitude towards
  submitting an old channel state than LN (the old state is superseded without punishment), but it needs
  \texttt{ANYPREVOUT}. Because eltoo and LN function similarly, the previous comparison of
  Elmo with LN applies to eltoo as well. On a related note, the payment
  logic of Elmo could also be designed based on the eltoo mechanism instead of
  the currently used LN.

Perun~\cite{perun},
Thunderdome~\cite{avarikioti2025thunderdometimelockfreerationallysecurevirtual},
and GSCN~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/DziembowskiFH18} exploit the
  Turing-complete scripting language of Ethereum to build virtual state
  channels.
  GSCN uses a per-channel functionality and a recursive argument similar
  to that of our UC-security analysis. Their security argument is however
  flawed, as they incorrectly argue that every level is subroutine respecting
  with respect to the same environment and subroutines.
  We believe that, given the versatile Ethereum scripting, GSCN could be
  straightforwardly extended to support variadic channels.
  Similar features are provided by Celer~\cite{dong2018celer}.
  Hydra~\cite{cryptoeprint:2020:299} provides state channels for
  Cardano~\cite{cardano}.

  Closer to Elmo, several works propose virtual channel constructions
  for Bitcoin. LVPC~\cite{10.1007/978-3-030-65411-5_18} enables a virtual channel to be
  opened on top of two preexisting channels using a technique similar to DMC,
  unfortunately inheriting the fixed lifetime limitation.
  Let \emph{simple channels} be those built directly on-chain, i.e., channels that are not
  virtual, such as LN.
  Bitcoin-Compatible Virtual Channels~\cite{9519487} enables
  virtual channels on top of two preexisting simple channels
  and offers two protocols, the first of which guarantees that the channel will
  stay off-chain for an agreed period, while the second allows the single intermediary
  to turn the virtual into a simple channel.
  This strategy has the shortcoming that even if it is made
  recursive (a direction left open in~\cite{9519487}) after $k$
  applications of the constructor the virtual channel participant will have to
  publish on-chain $k$ transactions in order to close the channel if all
  intermediaries actively monitor the blockchain.

  Donner~\cite{donner}
    (released originally concurrently with the first technical report of Elmo) 
%  is the first work 
%  to 
achieves variadic, but not recursive
  virtual channels. This is
  done by having the funder lock as
  collateral twice the amount of the useful channel funds: once on-chain with
  funds that are external to the \emph{base channels} (i.e., the channels that the
  virtual channel is based on) and once off-chain within its base channel. Thus
  Donner requires the funder to keep locked and unusable an amount of coins
  equal to those in the virtual channel, creating a considerable opportunity
  cost. As this is not needed in other
  constructions, the funder's collateral in Donner is double that of LVPC or Elmo. The
  collateral for all other parties is the same
  across LVPC, Donner, and Elmo.
  Additionally, a Donner channel needs active periodic collaboration of the
  endpoints and all base channel parties to refresh
  its lifetime, therefore a Donner channel does not have a truly unlimited
  lifetime. We conjecture that using external coins precludes variadic
  virtual channels with unlimited lifetime. This
  design choice further means that Donner is not symmetric. Donner also uses
  placeholder outputs which, due to the minimum coins they need to
  exceed Bitcoin's \emph{dust limit}, may skew the incentives of rational players
  and add to the channel
  opportunity cost. The aforementioned incentives
  together with its lack of recursiveness mean that if a party with coins in a
  Donner channel decides to use them with another party, it first has to close
  its channel either off-chain, which needs cooperation of all intermediaries, or
  else on-chain, with all the delays and fees this entails.
  Further, its design complicates
  future iterations that lift its current restriction that only one of the two
  channel parties can fund the virtual channel. On the positive side, Donner is
  more efficient than Elmo in terms of storage, computation and communication
  complexity, and boasts a simpler design. 
  %, but has less room for optimisations and is not recursive. 
  Their work also introduces the \emph{Domino attack},
  which we address in Section~\ref{sec:future-work}.

  related work, including a technical issue in Donner and its resolution.
