	abstract = {Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum execute payment transactions securely, but their performance is limited by the need for global consensus. Payment networks overcome this limitation through off-chain transactions. Instead of writing to the blockchain for each transaction, they only settle the final payment balances with the underlying blockchain. When executing off-chain transactions in current payment networks, parties must access the blockchain within bounded time to detect misbehaving parties that deviate from the protocol. This opens a window for attacks in which a malicious party can steal funds by deliberately delaying other parties' blockchain access and prevents parties from using payment networks when disconnected from the blockchain.We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes off-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying blockchain. To prevent parties from misbehaving, Teechain uses treasuries, protected by hardware trusted execution environments (TEEs), to establish off-chain payment channels between parties. Treasuries maintain collateral funds and can exchange transactions efficiently and securely, without interacting with the underlying blockchain. To mitigate against treasury failures and to avoid having to trust all TEEs, Teechain replicates the state of treasuries using committee chains, a new variant of chain replication with threshold secret sharing. Teechain achieves at least a 33X higher transaction throughput than the state-of-the-art Lightning payment network. A 30-machine Teechain deployment can handle over 1 million Bitcoin transactions per second.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/3419614.3423248,
  abstract = {The Lightning Network promises to alleviate Bitcoin's known
  scalability problems. The operation of such second layer approaches relies on
  the ability of participants to turn to the blockchain to claim funds at any
  time, which is assumed to happen rarely.One of the risks that was identified
  early on is that of a wide systemic attack on the protocol, in which an
  attacker triggers the closure of many Lightning channels at once. The
  resulting high volume of transactions in the blockchain will not allow for
  the proper settlement of all debts, and attackers may get away with stealing
  some funds.This paper explores the details of such an attack and evaluates
  its cost and overall impact on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.
  Specifically, we show that an attacker is able to simultaneously cause victim
  nodes to overload the Bitcoin blockchain with requests and to steal funds
  that were locked in channels.We go on to examine the interaction of Lightning
  nodes with the fee estimation mechanism and show that the attacker can
  continuously lower the fee of transactions that will later be used by the
  victim in its attempts to recover funds - eventually reaching a state in
  which only low fractions of the block are available for lightning
  transactions. Our attack is made easier even further as the Lightning
  protocol allows the attacker to increase the fee offered by his own
  transactions.We show that the vast majority of nodes agree to channel opening
  requests from unknown sources and are therefore susceptible to this attack.
  We highlight differences between various implementations of the Lightning
  Network protocol and review the susceptibility of each one to the attack.
  Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to lower the systemic attack risk
  of the network.},

abstract = {Bitcoin owes its success to the fact that transactions are transparently recorded in the blockchain, a global public ledger that removes the need for trusted parties. Unfortunately, recording every transaction in the blockchain causes privacy, latency, and scalability issues. Building on recent proposals for "micropayment channels" --- two party associations that use the ledger only for dispute resolution --- we introduce techniques for constructing anonymous payment channels. Our proposals allow for secure, instantaneous and private payments that substantially reduce the storage burden on the payment network. Specifically, we introduce three channel proposals, including a technique that allows payments via untrusted intermediaries. We build a concrete implementation of our scheme and show that it can be deployed via a soft fork to existing anonymous currencies such as ZCash.},
