\begin{abstract}
  Blockchains have inherently limited throughput and latency. A variety of
  so-called Layer 2 technologies attempt to solve this problem in a number of
  independent ways. Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) constitute one of the most
  prominent such approaches. The Lightning Network (LN), which uses Bitcoin as
  its blockchain, is currently the most widely used PCN. In LN, payments to a
  new recipient either need opening a new channel with a single on-chain
  transaction, or can be done through a number of completely off-chain multi-hop
  payments. Multi-hop payments however may fail due to faults by the
  intermediaries, routing becomes an issue, payment delay is proportional to the
  number of intermediaries and per-payment privacy suffers.

  We propose Recursive Channels, which allow for new channels to be trustlessly
  opened on top of an arbitrarily long path of existing channels, therefore
  allowing the parties to directly pay each other multiple times, without
  implicating the intermediaries for every payment. Such channels can be also
  opened in a recursive manner, i.e. the preexisting channels may themselves be
  virtual, thus answering the previously posed question of feasibility in the
  affirmative.
