\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:security:simple}]
  By inspection of Figures~\ref{code:functionality:rules}
  and~\ref{code:simulator:flow} we can deduce that for a particular
  \environment, in the ideal world execution $\textsc{exec}^{\fchansup{1},
  \ledger}_{\simulator_{\adversary}, \environment}$, $\simulator_{\adversary}$
  simulates internally the two $\pchansup{1}$ parties exactly as they would execute in
  $\textsc{exec}^{\ledger}_{\pchansup{1}, \adversary, \environment}$, the real world
  execution, in case $\fchansup{1}$ does not halt. Indeed, $\fchansup{1}$ only halts with
  negligible probability according to Lemma~\ref{lemma:no-halt}, therefore the
  two executions are computationally indistinguishable.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:security:virtual}]
  The proof is exactly the same as that of
  Theorem~\ref{theorem:security:simple}, replacing superscripts $1$ for $n$.
\end{proof}
