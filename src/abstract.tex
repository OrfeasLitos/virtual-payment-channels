\begin{abstract} 
A dominant approach towards the solution of the scalability problem
in blockchain systems has been the development of layer 2
protocols and specifically payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the Lightning Network (LN) over Bitcoin. 
%
Routing payments over LN requires the coordination of all path intermediaries
in a multi-hop round trip that 
encumbers the layer 2 solution both in terms of responsiveness as well as privacy. 
%
The issue is resolved by \emph{virtual channel} protocols that, capitalizing on a
suitable off-chain setup operation, enable the two endpoints to engage as if
they had a direct payment channel between them. Once the channel is unneeded, it
can be optimistically closed in an off-chain fashion.

Apart from communication 
efficiency, virtual channel constructions 
have three natural desiderata. 
A virtual channel constructor is {\em recursive} if it can also be applied on pre-existing virtual channels, {\em variadic} if it can be applied on any number of pre-existing channels and {\em symmetric} if it encumbers in an equitable fashion all channel participants both in collaborative and non-collaborative execution paths.
We put forth the first Bitcoin-suitable recursive variadic virtual channel
construction. Furthermore our virtual channel constructor is symmetric and
offers optimal round complexity for payments, optimistic closing and unilateral
closing. We express and prove the security of our construction in the universal
composition setting, using a novel induction-based proof technique of
independent interest. As an additional contribution, we implement a flexible
simulation framework for on- and off-chain payments and compare the efficiency
of our protocol with previous virtual channel constructors.
