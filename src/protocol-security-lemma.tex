\begin{lemma}[Real world balance security]
  Let $P$ honest \textsc{ln} ITI such that all of the following are true:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the internal variable \texttt{negligent} of $P$ has value ``False'',
    \item $P$ has transitioned to the \textsc{open} \textit{State} after having
    received $(\textsc{open}, c, \dots)$ by either \environment or another
    \textsc{ln} ITI $\bar{P}$,
    \item $P$ [has received $(\textsc{fund me}, f_i, \dots)$ as input by another
    \textsc{ln} ITI while \textit{State} was \textsc{open} and subsequently $P$
    transitioned to \textsc{open} \textit{State}] $n$ times,
    \item $P$ [has received $(\textsc{pay}, d_i)$ by \environment while
    \textit{State} was \textsc{open} and $P$ subsequently transitioned to
    \textsc{open} \textit{State}] $m$ times,
    \item $P$ [has received $(\textsc{pay}, e_i, \dots)$ by $\bar{P}$ while
    \textit{State} was \textsc{open} and $P$ subsequently transitioned to
    \textsc{open} \textit{State}] $l$ times.
  \end{itemize}
  Let $\phi = 1$ if $P = \alice$, or $\phi = 0$ if $P = \bob$. If $P$ receives
  $(\textsc{close})$ by \environment, then eventually the state obtained when
  $P$ inputs $(\textsc{read})$ to \ledger will contain $h$ $(c_i, \pk{P,
  \mathrm{out}})$ outputs such that
  \begin{equation}
    \sum\limits_{i=1}^h c_i \geq \phi \cdot c - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i -
    \sum\limits_{i=1}^m d_i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^l e_i \enspace.
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
